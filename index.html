<p><font face="Gabriola" color="red">My Piece is called modern religion My medium is digital media using photoshop and illustrator I created this piece because I always like using art historical references in my art. I am not the most religious person so this icons in this piece are mainly for aesthetic purposes. I chose the word modern because recently on Tumblr, there has been certain trends of cool toned statues being distorted as art and since the works of art were religious, I thought it be fit to title this piece that. It was fun creating this as I got to incorporate what I deemed visually pleasing and the effects chosen added to the depth of the piece</font></p>
